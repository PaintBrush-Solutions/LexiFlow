LexiFlow
========

LexiFlow is a web-based user interface designed to streamline the translation process of content stored in Google Spreadsheets. It provides translators with a simple, intuitive UI to enter and manage translations row-by-row, making the task of translating large volumes of text easier and more organized. LexiFlow ensures that translators can focus on content without getting lost in complex spreadsheets.

Project Overview
----------------

The goal of LexiFlow is to create a user-friendly interface that integrates with Google Spreadsheets to support translation work. Often, translation teams rely on spreadsheets to maintain multiple columns of source and target languages, which can quickly become overwhelming. LexiFlow aims to simplify this by displaying one row at a time and enabling translators to enter, edit, and save translations efficiently.

This tool supports use cases where multiple columns of source text are present, as well as situations where individual cells may contain significant amounts of text, such as paragraphs or lengthy descriptions.

Key Features
------------

- **Single-Row Translation View**: Displays one row at a time, so translators can work on specific segments without distraction.
- **Multiple Source Columns**: Handles multiple source columns in the spreadsheet, allowing translations for each column to be added individually.
- **Editable Target Column**: Provides a dedicated input field for the target language, making it easy to add and edit translations.
- **Edit Previously Entered Translations**: Allows users to navigate back to previous rows to review and revise translations as needed.

Future Enhancements
-------------------

While LexiFlow will initially focus on core functionality, additional features may be added in the future, such as:

- **Translation Memory**: Suggest translations based on previously entered text, aiding consistency across similar entries.
- **Quality Checks**: Implement optional quality checks to alert users of inconsistencies or incomplete translations.
- **Multilingual Support**: Expand support for projects that involve translating into multiple target languages.

Development Environment
-----------------------

- **Languages/Frameworks**: This project is developed using either Python or JavaScript frameworks, with a preference for React for the front-end.
